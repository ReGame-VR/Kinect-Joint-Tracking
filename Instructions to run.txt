- Kinect SDK data is the folder on the desktop
- copy the path and paste it in line 150 (to change the directory where it saves) in DIR string
- add double \\ after paste it 
- inside folder is file called Kinect Data
- line 152 string called file is the file name  without the .txt (in case want to change it later)
